# CC_Lab3

changed the __init__.py file of cart 
and the __init__.py file of products 
For the cart/__init__.py file, the main focus was on improving efficiency and 
security. The original code used eval to process cart contents, which is 
risky because it can execute arbitrary code. This was replaced with 
json.loads, a much safer alternative for parsing serialized data. The nested 
loops for handling cart items were also streamlined into a single step using 
a generator, making the code cleaner and reducing unnecessary iterations. 
Additionally, the load method was refactored into a @staticmethod for 
better structure and usability, aligning with Python's best practices. Overall, 
these changes make the code faster, safer, and easier to maintain. 
For browse/__init__.py, the optimizations were mainly about simplifying the 
logic and removing redundant steps. The list_products function was 
rewritten to use a direct list comprehension, which eliminates the need for 
intermediate loops while achieving the same result. The load method was 
also converted into a static method for consistency and better design. 
These changes ensure the module handles product data more efficiently 
and keeps the codebase organized. 
Both files were updated without altering their functionality, focusing 
instead on making the implementation more robust and efficient.
